# 2D-Platformer-Game
This contains the code and assets for a game I've been working on. This began its life as game jam entry but it has evolved a lot since then.

Game description: It's essentialy a 2 player split-screen racing game where you need to be the first to platform to the top of the level. Each player can shapeshift between 3 different animals which have different attributes such as jump height. 

If you want to look at the code, "player_controller.cs" is probably the most interesting (and actually has comments!).
